# E2E-Hackathon
This document contains code which addresses the following prompt from the E2E Cornell hackathon:

Artificial intelligence (AI) facial recognition appears to be the wave of the future when it comes to rapidly identifying individuals without human intervention.
AI is being utilized to screen applicants during the hiring process, identify suspects linked to various crimes, 
and verify identities in a multitude of settings with the promise of fewer errors due to human biases. However, 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that most facial recognition algorithms do in fact exhibit bias; 
they falsely identify Black and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more often than they do white faces. How can we minimize biases while still harnessing the power of AI?
